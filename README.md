# Kick-Your-Ass

## Overview

Kick-Your-Ass is an innovative tool designed to address the emotional value of individuals during the crypto bear market. It provides a platform where users can express their emotions by directly kicking the ass of certain projects or individuals they are dissatisfied with, or by showing appreciation through a "kiss face" gesture.

## Why on IC?

1. Barrier-free access - No need to hold ICP tokens.
2. Low latency - Ensures a seamless user experience.
3. Excellent scalability - Fully on-chain, capable of handling high user concurrency.
4. Real-time avatar import from Twitter handles through HTTP outcall support.

## Future Developments

1. Ass-Kicking Index - Calculating an index for each imported Twitter handle, reflecting their controversy and conflict on social media platforms. This helps identify projects despised due to rug behavior and organizations making a positive impact (e.g., DFINITY).
2. NFT Minting - Minting NFTs capturing the moment a Twitter handle receives its first ass-kicking. Users can save and share these moments, adding potential commemorative value. For instance, an NFT capturing Elon Musk's first ass-kicking could be valued at 100 ICP.

We are excited about the potential of Kick-Your-Ass in the crypto community. By providing a unique platform for expressing emotions and generating commemorative NFTs, we aim to enhance user engagement and create an interactive environment.
